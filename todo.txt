- Create listwise loss
- Create lis-scorer and list-dataset
- Safe the model names to avoid the initial model name colleciton
- Test long training in other infrastructure (maybe colab)

- Create a table with prompt-model and learn a portfolio- > learn a set of good initial portfolio
- Select the most difficult samples, to use as portfolio for selecting the model
- Create my own dataset usinng prompt portfolio to evaluate on ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok

- select from multiple maximums int he router
- Organize datasets. Use human preference or bert score

- Cold start problem:
    Create a model for embedding LLMs: features, performance metrics, graph embeddings.
    * Idea for creating embeddings with performance metrics:
    * NLL on a subset of selected samples, selected by the training data

- predict OOM errors
- Library with differents
    * Datasets
    * Router
    * Performance Score
    * Token Cost
