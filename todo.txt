- Code for training LLM routers with Bert
- Code for simple LLM routers using prompt complexity
- Organize datasets. Use human preference or bert score

- Create a model for embedding LLMs: features, performance metrics, graph embeddings.
    * Idea for creating embeddings with performance metrics:
    * NLL on a subset of selected samples, selected by the training data

- predict OOM errors
- Library with differents
    * Datasets
    * Router
    * Performance Score
    * Token Cost
